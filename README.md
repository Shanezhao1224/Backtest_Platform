# Backtest_Platform

## This is my basic stock backtesting platform

Right now it has the currently capabilities:

1. Read an OHLC bar (Open High Low Close) csv file
2. Use a specific user implemented strategy class
3. Simulate portfolio results over the OHLC file over the date range

A basic BUY open, SELL close (BOSC) strategy is given as an example.
To get started the Tutorial_main.py script is given, which will run the simulation with the BOSC strategy and graph the results.
